## iOS App Store compliance — features that must NOT appear on iOS

The iOS App Store build is produced with `VITE_DISABLE_EXCHANGE=true`
(`bun run build:ios`). Any feature that could be classified as crypto
exchange, swap, bridge, trading, or off-ramp must be hidden on iOS.

Before adding such a feature:

1. Add a gate in `src/lib/native/capabilities.ts` (or extend an existing one).
2. Wrap the UI entry point(s) with that gate so the feature is unreachable
   when the gate returns `false`.
3. Ensure the feature's route/component does not appear in iOS screenshots or
   navigation when gated.
4. Build iOS with `bun run build:ios` and verify the feature is absent.

Current gates:

- `exchangeFeaturesAllowed()` / `useExchangeFeaturesAllowed()` — swap and
  bridge features (LI.FI EVM swaps, THORChain LTC/DOGE swaps, Tron bridge).

If the user asks for a feature and does not explicitly say it should be on iOS,
default to excluding it from iOS. Ask the user for confirmation when unsure.
