      <h2>The short version</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No account. No email. No password reset.</li>
        <li>No analytics, no tracking pixels, no third-party cookies.</li>
        <li>Your seed phrase is encrypted on your own device and never sent anywhere.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What stays on your device</h2>
      <p>
        Your BIP39 seed phrase and any optional BIP39 passphrase are encrypted with a key derived
        from your wallet password (PBKDF2-SHA256, 600,000 iterations) and stored in your
        browser's local storage. The unencrypted seed exists only in memory while the wallet is
        unlocked.
      </p>

      <h2>What we ask the network</h2>
      <p>
        To show balances and broadcast transactions, the app talks to public TEXITcoin
        infrastructure (currently <code>mempool.texitcoin.org</code>). Those servers see your
        addresses and the IP address of your device the same way any blockchain explorer does.
        We do not run those servers and do not log any of those requests on our side.
      </p>

      <h2>Price data</h2>
      <p>
        If TXC price is shown, it is fetched server-side from a public price API. Your wallet
        addresses are not sent with that request.
      </p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>The app is not directed to children under 13.</p>
