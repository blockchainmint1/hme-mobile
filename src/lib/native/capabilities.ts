 * features on Android and the web build, and hard-disable them on iOS.
 *
 * Two independent switches, so a mistake in either direction fails closed:
 *  1. Build-time: `VITE_DISABLE_EXCHANGE=true` (set for App Store builds).
 *  2. Runtime: the Capacitor platform reports `ios`.
 *
 * See AGENTS.md: any new exchange-like feature must be gated here and hidden
 * from iOS before it ships.
