/**
 * Central definition of the app's security headers, so the SSR server
 * (src/start.ts) and the HTML shell (src/routes/__root.tsx) can't drift.
 *
 * The Content-Security-Policy is the single most important control for a
 * wallet: even if a script is somehow injected (XSS, a compromised
 * dependency, an MITM without cert pinning), a strict `connect-src` prevents
 * it from exfiltrating the seed phrase or password to an attacker-controlled
 * server, and `object-src` / `base-uri` / `form-action` close common
 * escalation vectors.
 *
 * NOTE on `script-src`: this SSR React app relies on framework-generated
 * inline hydration scripts plus two small inline bootstrap scripts in
 * __root.tsx. Locking `script-src` to hashes/nonces requires threading a
 * per-request nonce through TanStack Start and is tracked as a follow-up
 * (see SECURITY-AUDIT.md, H2). Until then we keep `'unsafe-inline'` on
 * `script-src` ONLY. That does not weaken the exfiltration protection, which
 * comes from `connect-src`.
 *
 * Client-side network destinations that must stay in `connect-src`:
 *   - 'self'                          same-origin API proxy + server functions
 *   - https://mempool.texitcoin.org  TXC balance/UTXO/broadcast (client fetch)
 *   - https://mempool.iskandercoin.com  ISK balance/UTXO/broadcast (client fetch)
 * Everything else (Alchemy, CoinMarketCap, LI.FI, Nectar) is called from the
 * server only, so it must NOT be added here.
