/**
 * Reliable EVM broadcast helper.
 *
 * Problem this solves: sending twice in a row would reuse the same nonce.
 * viem asks the node for the "pending" nonce, but several nodes we talk to
 * (ZCU especially) answer with the mined ("latest") count, so the second send
 * collides with the first and the node rejects it as
 * `replacement transaction underpriced`.
 *
 * Fix: every send *reserves* its own nonce. We take max(latest, pending,
 * locally-reserved + 1) so the counter stays ahead even when the node
 * under-reports pending transactions, and a collision retries on the NEXT
 * nonce (a new transaction) instead of bumping the fee, which would have
 * replaced — and cancelled — the earlier send.
