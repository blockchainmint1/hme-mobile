/**
 * Capacitor config for the HME Wallet mobile app.
 *
 * The web app is served from TanStack Start's static SPA output.
 * `bun run build` writes or mirrors the static bundle to `dist/client` and
 * generates `dist/client/index.html`, which is the native webview entry point.
 * When developing against a live Lovable preview, set `server.url` to the
 * preview URL instead of bundling.
 */
/**
 * SECURITY: a release build MUST bundle the web assets inside the binary and
 * NOT load them from a remote URL. Loading `server.url` at runtime means the
 * store binary is a thin shell that executes whatever JavaScript the server
 * serves at launch, so a server/CDN compromise or one bad deploy can push code
 * that steals seed phrases from every user. It also has no Subresource
 * Integrity and is a poor fit for App Store 2.5.2 / Play policy. See
 * SECURITY-AUDIT.md (H1).
 *
 * Default here is BUNDLED (no `server.url`). To live-reload against a remote
 * preview during development only, set `HME_REMOTE_URL`, e.g.
 *   HME_REMOTE_URL=https://id-preview--xxxx.lovable.app bunx cap sync ios
 * Never ship a release with `HME_REMOTE_URL` set.
 *
 * MIGRATION-CRITICAL: `hostname` is kept at "mobile.honest.money" with the
 * https scheme so the bundled build serves its assets under the SAME origin
 * the remote build used. localStorage (the encrypted wallet) is keyed by
 * origin — if the origin changed (e.g. to capacitor://localhost), existing
 * users' wallets would become unreadable and they'd have to re-import from
 * seed. Do NOT change `hostname` without a data-migration plan. See
 * SECURITY-AUDIT.md (H1 migration note).
